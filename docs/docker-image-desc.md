# What is the Provider UI?

The Provider User Interface (provider-ui) is a provider user interface component of Consent2Share used to create and manage patient accounts. Provider can use this to log in, visit their home page, create patient accounts, and manage patient consents.

# How to use this image

## Start a provider-ui instance

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the repository's [README.md](https://github.com/bhits-dev/provider-ui) file before starting the instance.

`docker run  --name provider-ui -d bhitsdev/provider-ui:latest <additional program arguments>`

*NOTE: In order for this API to fully function as a microservice in the Consent2Share application, it is required to setup the dependency microservices and the support level infrastructure. Please refer to the Consent2Share Deployment Guide in the corresponding Consent2Share release (see [Consent2Share Releases Page](https://github.com/bhits-dev/consent2share/releases)) for instructions to setup the Consent2Share infrastructure.*

## Configure

The Spring profiles `application-default` and `docker` are activated by default when building images.

This API can run with the default configuration, which is from three places: `bootstrap.yml`, `application.yml`, and the data which the [`Configuration Server`](https://github.com/bhits-dev/config-server) reads from the `Configuration Data Git Repository`. Both `bootstrap.yml` and `application.yml` files are located in the class path of the running application.

We **recommend** overriding the configuration as needed in the `Configuration Data Git Repository`, which is used by the `Configuration Server`.

Also, [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) supports other ways to override the default configuration to configure the API for a certain deployment environment. 

The following is an example to override the default configuration:

`docker run -d bhitsdev/provider-ui:latest --c2s.provider-ui.oauth2.client.secret=strongpassword`

## Environment Variables

`docker run --name provider-ui -e "JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx700m -Xss1m" -d bhitsdev/provider-ui:latest`

### DEFAULT_PROGRAM_ARGS
